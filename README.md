# Learn-React

Welcome to my Learning React Repo. 

This is where I documented my notes while learning react. Most of these notes are from [Codevolutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFaFIcGhPoM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgg3vaYJgHGnModB54rxOk3) amazing tutortials.
The React router is from [DevEds Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Law7wfdg_ls)
